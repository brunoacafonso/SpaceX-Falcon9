# SpaceX Falcon 9
 In this repository, I am using SpaceX Falcon 9 launch data to predict landing success of a launch.
 This project is based on the Applied Data Science Capstone course, which is the last course of Coursera's Data Science Professional Certificate.
 
 However, I have improved not only many of the analyses in order to improve that prediction, but I have also increased the detail in the explanations of what is being done in each line of code.

 ### Webscraping Falcon 9 and Heavy Falcon launches
 An alternative way to obtain data on SpaceX launches. Instead of using the API from the SpaceX website, in this file we web scrape the data from a Wikipedia web page.
